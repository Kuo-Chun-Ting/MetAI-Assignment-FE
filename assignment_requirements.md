**Duration:** 48 hours (from receipt of this document)  
**Estimated Effort:** 4–6 hours of focused work

## Objective

Build a File Management Web Application that allows users to:

1. Sign up and log in/out
2. Upload (max 50MB), view, download, and delete files
3. View upload progress
4. See a paginated or sortable list of uploaded files
5. Preview image thumbnails, if applicable

You may use any framework or language you prefer.  
However, JavaScript/TypeScript is preferred for the frontend and Python for the backend.

## Requirements

### 1. Backend (API)
- Create a RESTful or GraphQL API.
- Store file metadata in a database:
  - filename
  - URL
  - size
  - upload timestamp
- Use Supabase (or any other free cloud service) for:
  - PostgreSQL database
  - File storage
- Alternatively, you may use:
  - Other free cloud DBs such as Neon, PlanetScale, or MongoDB Atlas
  - S3-compatible storage

---

### 2. Frontend
- Build a simple, functional UI that allows users to:
  - Upload file(s)
  - View a list of uploaded files
  - Edit file metadata
  - Delete file(s)
- A clean and professional design is appreciated, but UI polish is not the main focus.

---

### 3. Deployment
- The app must be accessible via a public URL and fully functional.
- Suggested platforms:
  - Frontend: Vercel, Netlify, or Render (free)
  - Backend: Render, Railway, or Vercel Serverless Functions
  - Database & Storage: Supabase (free tier)

---

## Deliverables

1. A link to the live deployed application
2. A link to the GitHub repository
3. A short README including:
   - Setup & local run instructions
   - Description of architecture and design decisions
   - Any trade-offs or known limitations
   - (Optional) Future improvements you would make
